        Hi there!

        We try to understand you
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Go to the homepage, and select what mood(s) you're in.
        Once you click next, we recommend you a couple of rooms to check out.
        Pick one you think you like, and you will join the room.
        We'll start playing music for you, and you can chat with people in the same mood as you are!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        This song doesn't fit the room, why am I hearing this?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        We're constantly trying to improve the system. You can give us feedback to help us.
        If you think a song fits the current mood, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></i> button in the room.
        This way, we know whe made the right recommendation. Similarly, if the song does not fit the room, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-down"></i> button.
        We'll try to modify the system based on your feedback. If you want to help us even better, you can use the popup to modify the rating of the song to your vision.
